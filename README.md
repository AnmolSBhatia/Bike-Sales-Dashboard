# Bike-Sales-Dashboard
In this Project, I took the data from kaggle which included Bike Sales Data.
Beginning with I cleaned the data which included removing duplicates, formatting of data, changing of particular attributes to remove confusion, changing of data types and their formatting to obtain clean data.
After that constructed Pivot tables which included Average Income per purchase based on gender, purchase of bikes depending upon age brackets and purchase of bikes depending upon commute distance per customer.
In the end  prepared the final dashboard along with proper formatting.
